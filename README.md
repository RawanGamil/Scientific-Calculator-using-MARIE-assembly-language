# Scientific-Calculator-using-MARIE-assembly-language

It's a simple scientific calculator built from SCRATCH using Marie assembly language.
The code should run on the Marie simulator: https://marie.js.org/ 
To use the calculator you can open the Marie simulator and upload the .mas file named "Simple Scientific Calculator",
OR you can copy the code from the text filed I uploaded and paste it into the Marie simulator.
### Don't forget to read the instructions carefully!

## User instructions

Notes : - The program can manipulate negative numbers
        - The program cannot deal with decimals, so do not use decimal numbers if you want accurate results

### I.	Addition
If you want to add two numbers, you have to run the program then enter â€˜1â€™ as input. You then enter the first number and the second number, and you will get their sum in the output.
II.	Subtraction
If you want to subtract two numbers, you have to run the program then enter â€˜2â€™ as input. You then enter the first number and the second number, and you will get their difference in the output.
 
### III.	Multiplication
If you want to multiply two numbers, you have to run the program then enter â€˜3â€™ as input. You then enter the first number and the second number, and you will get their product in the output.

### IV.	Division
If you want to divide two numbers, you have to run the program then enter â€˜4â€™ as input. You then enter the first number and the second number, and you will get the result in the output.  Make sure your denominator is not 0.

### V.	Power
If you want to get the power of a number, you have to run the program then enter â€˜5â€™ as input. You first have to enter the exponent and then the number, and you will get the result in the output.

### VI.	Factorial
If you want to get the factorial of a number, you have to run the program then enter â€˜6â€™ as input. You then enter the number you want its factorial, and you will get the result in the output.
VII.	Max, Min 
If you want to know the maximum and minimum between two numbers. You have to run the program then enter â€˜7â€™ as input. You then enter the first number and the second number, and the program will first print the bigger number and it will print the smallest one.



### VIII.	Triangle Detection 
If you want to check whether the shape you have is a triangle or not. You have to run the program then enter â€˜9â€™ as input. You then enter the three angles you have, the program will check their sum. If it is 180 then the shape is a triangle, otherwise itâ€™s not a triangle.
In case it is a triangle you will get 1 as output.
In case if itâ€™s not, you will get  0 as output.

### IX.	Trigonometry 
If you want to calculate the sin, cos or tan of any angle in your triangle, you have to run the program then enter â€˜10â€™ as input. 
First you will enter the value of the 1st side of the triangle, then the value of the 2nd side of your triangle. After this you will get 1 as an output, the means the program named the angle between side 1 and side 2, angle 1. Then you will enter the value of the 3rd side of the triangle you have. You will get 2 as output, this means the program named the angle between side 2 and side 3, angle 2. And then you will get 3 as output, this means the program named the angle between side 3 and side 1, angle 3.
After that the program will print the largest side between the three sides you have entered, so you make sure that this is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
If you want the sin, cos and tan of angle 1 : enter 1
If you want the sin, cos and tan of angle 2 : enter 2
If you want the sin, cos and tan of angle 3 : enter 3
After you enter 1, 2 or 3 you will get the sin, cos and tan of the angle you chose.
The first output is the sin, the second is the cos and the third is the tan.
